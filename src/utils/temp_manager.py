"""
src/utils/temp_manager.py
-------------------------
Utility for tracking and automatically cleaning up temporary files and directories
on application exit using Python's atexit module and tempfile utilities.

Provides functions to register temporary paths for automatic cleanup,
create managed temp files/directories, purge expired files, calculate
total disk space consumed by temporary work files, and rotate backup files.

Recent Additions (Issue #1251):
- Added `get_temp_directory_size_bytes` function that calculates total disk
  space occupied by all files inside the active temp directory recursively.

Recent Additions (Issue #1572):
- Added `rotate_backup_files` function that enforces retention policies on
  backup directories by keeping only the N most recent backup files.

    much disk space is currently consumed by temporary work files,
