src/core/text_chunking.py
-------------------------
Utilities for splitting raw extracted document text into processable chunks.

Two strategies are available:

* ``chunk_text``         – fixed character-count chunking with word-boundary
  awareness (original behaviour, preserved for backward compatibility).
* ``chunk_by_sentences``  – sentence-boundary-aware chunking that groups whole
  sentences into blocks up to *max_chunk_size* characters, ensuring no sentence
  is split mid-word or mid-clause.
